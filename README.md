### Well hello there.

My name is Lawrence, and I'm a software engineer and data scientist. You may know me as "Mevari Navalo" in FFXIV, though.

As of March 2021, I'm hired as a software dev by a company which I will hopefully stay with for the forseeable future. I have a seperate github account for my work there. In the meantime, this account will be for my personal projects and non-work related collaborations, such as bard software for the game FFXIV.
