### Well hello there.

My name is Lawrence, and I'm a software engineer and data scientist.

- I got my username from playing a lot of the character "Zenyatta" in the game Overwatch. Being both a Buddhist and a lover of robotics, he's the perfect match for me. 
- Iâ€™m currently working on filling out my portfolio a bit more with projects. Keep an eye here if you want to see what I end up doing.
- I went Boise State University, first for Mechanical Engineering before switching to Computer Science. Unfortuntately I did not get a degree before health and money issues made me take a break. 
- I was trained in the ways of Data Science at Lambda School. This is where a lot of my portfolio pieces come from. 
- I have worked in many langagues: Python, Java, C, C#, C++, Matlab, Ada, Lua, SQL... I might be forgetting one or two, as well. 
- Python is my favorite language, and my go-to for personal projects, but I have no hesitation using/learning whatever language asked of me. 
- I also like to make game mods. Some of my projects on here will be related to that.
